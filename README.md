## Objective
Wireshark Traffic Analysis and Network Attack Identification

This project focuses on using **Wireshark** to capture and analyze network traffic, with an emphasis on common protocols like **ARP**, **ICMP**, and **DNS**. The objective is to gain proficiency in using Wireshark filters, identify different packet types, and understand how to detect network attacks such as **ARP poisoning**, **ICMP tunneling**, and **DNS spoofing**.

### Skills Learned

- **Proficiency in using Wireshark for network traffic analysis**: Gained hands-on experience with capturing and analyzing network packets, using filters to efficiently examine traffic.
- **Understanding of common network protocols**: Developed a solid understanding of ARP, ICMP, and DNS protocols, and their roles in network communication.
- **Recognition of network security vulnerabilities**: Learned how to identify potential vulnerabilities such as ARP poisoning, ICMP tunneling, and DNS spoofing, which are critical to understanding network security risks.
- **Ability to detect and mitigate network attacks**: Acquired skills to recognize network attack patterns and apply defense strategies to identify and mitigate threats.
- **Critical thinking and problem-solving skills**: Strengthened analytical abilities through practical exercises, interpreting network data and identifying security threats based on observed patterns.

### Tools Used

- **Wireshark**: Utilized for capturing and analyzing network traffic, with a focus on filtering and interpreting ARP, ICMP, and DNS packets to detect potential network vulnerabilities and attacks.
- **Terminal**: Used for navigating and managing task files, running commands, and interacting with system files to support network analysis activities.
- **Network Protocol Analysis Tools**: Employed to inspect specific packet types (e.g., ARP, ICMP) and identify attack vectors such as ARP poisoning, ICMP tunneling, and DNS spoofing.
